        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Scramble eggs:</strong> 
                Using a small pat of butter, 
                scramble some eggs in a large sauté pan, breaking them
                into small pieces as you go. Then, set the scrambled eggs aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Sauté veggies and garlic:</strong> 
                Return your sauté pan to the heat, and sauté the onions, 
                carrots, peas and garlic until soft and cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stir fry rice:</strong> 
                Then turn the burner to high heat. Scooch the veggies over to 
                one side of the pan, melt the remaining butter in the other 
                half, and add the chilled rice, soy sauce, and oyster sauce 
                (if using). Then stir to combine with the veggies and continue
                sautéing the rice, stirring every 15-20 seconds or so for 3 
                minutes, or until you notice the rice and veggies starting 
                to brown slightly.
            </li>      
            <li>
                <strong>Remove pan from heat:</strong> 
                And stir in your green onions, sesame oil, and scrambled eggs.
            </li>              
            <li>
                <strong>Taste and season:</strong> 
                Give the rice a taste, and season with salt and pepper, 
                plus any extra soy sauce or sesame oil if needed.
            </li>         
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
